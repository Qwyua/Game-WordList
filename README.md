# üìå Game WordList API (for Developers)

Welcome to the **Game WordList API**! This project provides an easy way to fetch word lists for Game rooms using a simple JavaScript function.

## üöÄ How to Use?

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Adding the Library
To use `getWordList`, you need to load the script dynamically. You can do this in two ways:

#### Option 1: Using Fetch & Eval (Recommended)
```js
fetch("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/GameSketchers/Game-WordList/src/getWordList.min.js").then((t=>t.text())).then((js=>eval(js)));
```

#### Option 2: Adding a Script Tag
```js
const script = document.createElement("script");
script.src = "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/GameSketchers/Game-WordList/src/getWordList.min.js";
document.body.appendChild(script);
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Fetching Word Lists
You can retrieve word lists in two different ways:

#### Method 1: Using a Room Code
```js
const words = getWordList("324qc3");
console.log(words); // ["tofu", "vinaigrette", "meat", "parsley", "burrito", ...] 
```
This method extracts language and theme from the given code and fetches the corresponding word list.

#### Method 2: Using a Direct URL
```js
const words = getWordList("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/GameSketchers/Game-WordList/languages/English/foods.json");
console.log(words); // ["tofu", "vinaigrette", "meat", "parsley", "burrito", ...] 
```
This method fetches word lists directly from a valid GitHub repository URL.
